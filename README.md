# SecureCloudStorageDemo

A simple Angular 5 WebApp using `ngRx` for State management and common Bootstrap 3 for UI.
For HTTP I used `httpClient` and `HttpInterceptor` for authorization purposes.
WebApp also uses `routing` for navigation.

# Running the App with Docker
Since I implemented support for Docker and Docker Compose, you can run it via `docker-compose up` command from CLI.
Then in your browser navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` to get access to the app.

# Running the App with Ng
You can also run `ng serve` for a dev server and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

# Extras
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.4.
